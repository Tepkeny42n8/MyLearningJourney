  Today was an awesome day, I went to the studio.
  Met Ronnie Ron and the crew.
  Then we went and met the Gor Mahia Mlolongo Crew!
  Then went back to studio.

  I saw the need for insurance and teamwork!
  It is good when people meet together and work as one!
  It was a fair day!

  I felt bad, I will go to church next week.
  I look forward to a great week.

  Do not start a day without planning for it.
  Plan your tomorrow today.
  Have a goal for the day and the week.
